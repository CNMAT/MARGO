# Bill of Materials

Our first prototype, built in October 2022, uses the following items sourced from Adafruit and Mouser.  These items just happened to be on hand when we started this project. The ESP32-Devkit C - .  Persons intending to replicate this functionality may choose to attempt to use one of Adafruit's excellent ESP32 variants.  The Feather, for example, has built-in lipo battery charging, so one could forego the Micro-Lipo charger.  That said, we have encountered some snags using Feather with I2C in the past, so the code may need to be tweaked slightly in order to work.
